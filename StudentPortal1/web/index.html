Develop an application for course registration for Academic year 2022-2023. 

You need to provide the registration page with Reg. Number, Name and List of courses ( 10 Courses) 
along with its credits(2/3/4).  
You need validate that the student has taken minimum credits (16) 
and not exceeded the maximum credits (26). 
Once the student satisfies the minimum and maximum credits, 
you need to confirm the registration and update the details in the database. 
Finally, generate the course registration report ( Reg. Number, Name, Number of courses, total credits).
